				<p> I am passionate about building tools that are accessible and simple by design, but have a complex logic behind them. </p>
				<p> I learned to code as a hobby, which got me a couple of freelance projects.
					After working as a freelancer for a couple of years,
					I decided to level-up my skills and enrolled in CodeAcademy Advanced Front-End Developer Course. 
					These experiences provided me with a solid foundation in Typescript, React, and RESTful APIs.</p>
				<p> Currently, I am building up my skills further by learning Next.js full-stack development, and Rust back-end development.</p>
				<p> I am looking for a new role as a Front-End or Full-Stack developer. Lets connect!</p>
